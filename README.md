# **Analyzing Customer Churn**

### **Description**

This project analyzes the customer churn rate of a fictional telecommunications company called Databel. Power BI was used to generate visualizations and discover key patterns related to customer loss. Through this analysis, key factors affecting customer retention were identified, and strategies were proposed to improve it.

### **Objective**

- Determine the customer churn rate.
- Identify the main factors influencing customer loss.
- Propose recommendations to reduce the churn rate.

## **Key Insights**

1. **Competition as the Main Churn Factor:**  
   44.82% of customers who left did so due to better offers from competitors, representing the main cause of churn. This highlights the importance of improving competitive strategies.

2. **Age and Churn Rate:**  
   Customers over 80 years old have a churn rate of 52%, significantly higher than the average, indicating a possible disconnect between the services offered and the needs of this segment.

3. **Churn Rate in California:**  
   California has the highest churn rate (63.24%) despite having a low number of interactions with customer service. This finding suggests the need to further investigate the reasons behind this unusually high churn.
